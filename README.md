Overview of the Chatbot Code

This code implements a simple rule-based chatbot using the nltk (Natural Language Toolkit) library in Python. The chatbot is designed to interact with the user through predefined responses based on specific patterns in the user's input. Here's a summary of its key components:

Imports:

The script imports Chat and reflections from nltk.chat.util.
Chat is used to create the chatbot, and reflections helps handle pronouns (e.g., converting "I" to "you").
Pattern-Response Pairs:

The pairs list contains regular expressions that match user input, along with corresponding responses. For example:
When the user says "my name is [name]", the chatbot responds with "Hello [name], how can I assist you today?"
The chatbot also responds to greetings like "hi" or "hello" and can answer basic questions like "What is your name?".
If the user types "quit", the chatbot will exit the conversation with a goodbye message.
Chatbot Function:

The chatbot() function initializes the Chat object with the defined pairs and reflections, starting a conversation loop where the chatbot listens to user input and responds accordingly.
The chatbot continues interacting until the user types "quit".
Main Execution:

The script checks if it is being run as the main program and, if so, calls the chatbot() function to start the interaction.
